# Setup
Create an external table using the Yellow Taxi Trip Records.

Create a (regular/materialized) table in BQ using the Yellow Taxi Trip Records (do not partition or cluster this table).

# Question 1. Counting records
What is count of records for the 2024 Yellow Taxi Data?

- 65,623
- 840,402
- **20,332,093**
- 85,431,289

`SELECT count(*) FROM zoomcamp.yellow_tripdata_2024_ext`

# Question 2. Data read estimation
Write a query to count the distinct number of PULocationIDs for the entire dataset on both the tables.

What is the estimated amount of data that will be read when this query is executed on the External Table and the Table?

- 18.82 MB for the External Table and 47.60 MB for the Materialized Table
- **0 MB for the External Table and 155.12 MB for the Materialized Table** (?)
- 2.14 GB for the External Table and 0MB for the Materialized Table
- 0 MB for the External Table and 0MB for the Materialized Table



# Question 3. Understanding columnar storage
Write a query to retrieve the PULocationID from the table (not the external table) in BigQuery. Now write a query to retrieve the PULocationID and DOLocationID on the same table.

Why are the estimated number of Bytes different?

- **BigQuery is a columnar database, and it only scans the specific columns requested in the query. Querying two columns (PULocationID, DOLocationID) requires reading more data than querying one column (PULocationID), leading to a higher estimated number of bytes processed.**
- BigQuery duplicates data across multiple storage partitions, so selecting two columns instead of one requires scanning the table twice, doubling the estimated bytes processed.
- BigQuery automatically caches the first queried column, so adding a second column increases processing time but does not affect the estimated bytes scanned.
- When selecting multiple columns, BigQuery performs an implicit join operation between them, increasing the estimated bytes processed

# Question 4. Counting zero fare trips
How many records have a fare_amount of 0?

- 128,210
- 546,578
- 20,188,016
- **8,333**

# Question 5. Partitioning and clustering
What is the best strategy to make an optimized table in Big Query if your query will always filter based on tpep_dropoff_datetime and order the results by VendorID (Create a new table with this strategy)

- **Partition by tpep_dropoff_datetime and Cluster on VendorID**
- Cluster on by tpep_dropoff_datetime and Cluster on VendorID
- Cluster on tpep_dropoff_datetime Partition by VendorID
- Partition by tpep_dropoff_datetime and Partition by VendorID

Partitioning will allow that column to be focused while other columns will be skipped, so that querying is faster, clustering will further quicken the querying process through sorting of selected or defined column.

# Question 6. Partition benefits
Write a query to retrieve the distinct VendorIDs between tpep_dropoff_datetime 2024-03-01 and 2024-03-15 (inclusive)

Use the materialized table you created earlier in your from clause and note the estimated bytes. Now change the table in the from clause to the partitioned table you created for question 5 and note the estimated bytes processed. What are these values?

Choose the answer which most closely matches.

- 12.47 MB for non-partitioned table and 326.42 MB for the partitioned table
- **310.24 MB for non-partitioned table and 26.84 MB for the partitioned table**
- 5.87 MB for non-partitioned table and 0 MB for the partitioned table
- 310.31 MB for non-partitioned table and 285.64 MB for the partitioned table

# Question 7. External table storage
Where is the data stored in the External Table you created?

- Big Query
- Container Registry
- **GCP Bucket**
- Big Table

External table is not used in Big Query, Container Registry, now known as Artifact Registry, is to deal with container image storage and management on Google Cloud, Big Table is another external table database format that uses NoSQL.

# Question 8. Clustering best practices
It is best practice in Big Query to always cluster your data:

- True
- **False**

It is recommended by Google Cloud that clustering can be the first step to improve query performance. However, it only has its benefits on partitioned data where you want to fine tune the query performance. (?)

# Question 9. Understanding table scans
No Points: Write a SELECT count(*) query FROM the materialized table you created. How many bytes does it estimate will be read? Why?
0 bytes, possibly due to the COUNT function
