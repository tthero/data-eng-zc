# Question 1. dbt Lineage and Execution

Given a dbt project with the following structure:

```
models/
├── staging/
│   ├── stg_green_tripdata.sql
│   └── stg_yellow_tripdata.sql
└── intermediate/
    └── int_trips_unioned.sql (depends on stg_green_tripdata & stg_yellow_tripdata)
```

If you run dbt run --select int_trips_unioned, what models will be built?

- `stg_green_tripdata`, `stg_yellow_tripdata`, and `int_trips_unioned` (upstream dependencies)
- Any model with upstream and downstream dependencies to `int_trips_unioned`
- **[`int_trips_unioned` only]**
- `int_trips_unioned`, `int_trips`, and `fct_trips` (downstream dependencies)

# Question 2. dbt Tests

You've configured a generic test like this in your schema.yml:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: payment_type
    data_tests:
      - accepted_values:
          arguments:
            values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            quote: false
```

Your model `fct_trips` has been running successfully for months. A new value `6` now appears in the source data.

What happens when you run `dbt test --select fct_trips`?

- dbt will skip the test because the model didn't change
- **dbt will fail the test, returning a non-zero exit code**
- dbt will pass the test with a warning about the new value
- dbt will update the configuration to include the new value

# Question 3. Counting Records in fct_monthly_zone_revenue

After running your dbt project, query the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` model.

What is the count of records in the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` model?

    12,998
    14,120
    **12,184**
    15,421

```sql
select count(*) from prod.fct_monthly_zone_revenue;
```

# Question 4. Best Performing Zone for Green Taxis (2020)

Using the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` table, find the pickup zone with the highest total revenue (`revenue_monthly_total_amount`) for Green taxi trips in 2020.

Which zone had the highest revenue?

    **East Harlem North**
    Morningside Heights
    East Harlem South
    Washington Heights South

```sql
select pickup_zone, sum(revenue_monthly_fare) as revenue_total
from prod.fct_monthly_zone_revenue 
where revenue_month >= '2020-01-01' and service_type = 'Green'
group by pickup_zone
order by revenue_total desc;
```

# Question 5. Green Taxi Trip Counts (October 2019)

Using the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` table, what is the total number of trips (`total_monthly_trips`) for Green taxis in October 2019?

    500,234
    350,891
    **384,624**
    421,509

```sql
select sum(total_monthly_trips)
from prod.fct_monthly_zone_revenue 
where (revenue_month between '2019-10-01' and '2019-10-31') and service_type = 'Green';
```

# Question 6. Build a Staging Model for FHV Data

Create a staging model for the For-Hire Vehicle (FHV) trip data for 2019.

1. Load the FHV trip data for 2019 into your data warehouse
2. Create a staging model `stg_fhv_tripdata` with these requirements:
    - Filter out records where `dispatching_base_num IS NULL`
    - Rename fields to match your project's naming conventions (e.g., `PUlocationID` → `pickup_location_id`)

What is the count of records in `stg_fhv_tripdata`?

    42,084,899
    **43,244,693**
    22,998,722
    44,112,187
